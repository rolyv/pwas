Problem Statement: XYZ Printing Co. has been sustaining steady growth in business volume. As volume increases, so does the frequency of costly production mistakes due to human error and problems with internal communication. These problems stem from the order-taking and tracking process, which is largely ad-hoc. Customer satisfaction is negatively impacted, due to lack of timely information about their project's status.

XYZ has decided to develop a new web-based system that will take customer orders and track their status. Additionally, it should allow XYZ's employees to organize jobs and plan print-runs efficiently. This will allow XYZ's workforce to make better use of their time and facilitate the production process, thereby increasing organizational capacity and efficiency.
